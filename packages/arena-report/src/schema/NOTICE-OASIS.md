# Vendored: OASIS SARIF 2.1.0 JSON schema

`sarif-schema-2.1.0.json` in this directory is an **unmodified** copy of

    https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/errata01/os/schemas/sarif-schema-2.1.0.json

(SARIF Version 2.1.0 Plus Errata 01, OASIS Standard incorporating Approved Errata, 28 August 2023),
fetched 2026-09-26, sha256 `c3b4bb2d6093897483348925aaa73af03b3e3f4bd4ca38cef26dcb4212a2682e`.
It is vendored so that `npm run sarif:validate` and the tests never touch the network (CI has none).
`src/sarif-validate.ts` compiles it as published (JSON Schema draft-04, via `ajv-draft-04`); the file
itself is never edited. `test/sarif.test.ts` pins the digest above.

The OASIS notice below applies to that file and is reproduced as its terms require.
